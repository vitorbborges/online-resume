  details: |
    I am a 21 years data scientist studying Economics at the University of Brasília, and at the same time study Statistics with the intention of acquiring it as a second diploma. On the side I am a independent research assistant in many Data-Oriented projects at different facilities. I build some interesting research projects and experiment with trending Artificial Intelligence content.

    In my free time i like to study Mathematics, History and solve the Rubik's Cube (current single-solve record: 15.06s). Some personal research interests are Time Series Models, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I also like to study languages (currently learning German).
